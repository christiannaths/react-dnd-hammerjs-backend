A not-official implementation of a [React DnD](http://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/) backend,
based on [Hammer.JS](http://hammerjs.github.io) library for supporting both mouse-driven and touch-driven interaction.  

This project is EXPERIMENTAL and under development.

## Acknowledges

Since this is my first GitHub project and I'm new to the React world, it takes a lot from the following references:

  - [React DnD HTML5 Backend](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd-html5-backend) for the project structure;
  - [react-dnd-touch-backend](https://github.com/yahoo/react-dnd-touch-backend#readme) for the backend structure.

I just linked the backend to different events, provided by the [Hammer.JS](http://hammerjs.github.io) library.
